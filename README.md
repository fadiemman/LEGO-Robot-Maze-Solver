# Maze Bot Challenge

This repository contains the Java code for solving the Maze Bot Challenge.

## Description

In this Project, the task is to program a robot to navigate through a maze and find a target wall located in a dead end. The maze does not contain loops, and the start position of the robot is not revealed until the final date. The challenge involves exploring the entire maze and developing a suitable strategy to reach the target wall efficiently.

## Maze Simulator

The solution can be tested using a maze simulator provided in the repository. The simulator allows testing different mazes by configuring the maze file path and dimensions in the code. It is essential to ensure that the width and height parameters match the dimensions of the maze PNG file to ensure correct simulation performance.
